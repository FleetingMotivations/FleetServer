Fleet Server

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FleetingMotivations/FleetServer.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/FleetingMotivations/FleetServer)

Repo uses the git-flow branching convention
 - Feature branches `feature/<feature-name>`
 - Bugfix branches `bugfix/<bugfix-name>`
 - Testing/Examples `testing/client`

Get code onto develop by doing a pull request. Push your feature to origin and when it is complete, make a pull request and assign a code reviewer.

To see samples of the server in action, checkout the `testing/client` branch and run with admin priviledges.
